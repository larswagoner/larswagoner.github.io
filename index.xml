      <description>This is my now page, where I share what I&amp;rsquo;m up to right now. You can read more here.
 Studying mathematics in Amsterdam, with focus on algebra and geometry. Teaching assistant for a few first year courses (most recently, Group Theory). Playing basketball, going bouldering and mostly being bad at both! Sunset strolls in the nearby parks are a personal favorite. Trying to work through my evergrowing collection of books (Antonio Azor√≠n stands out).</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Lars.
I grew up in Spain but I currently live in Amsterdam. I can speak English and Spanish fluently, my French is probably not that bad, my Italian is decent if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian, and my Dutch is embarassingly weak. In general, I find mathematics and related fields interesting, in particular the intersection between pure math and AI. I spend a good amount of time reading (basically anything), so I will gladly accept any recommendations.</description>
