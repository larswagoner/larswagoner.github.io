      <description>Over the summer I was a Machine Learning Safety Scholar at the Center for AI Safety (CAIS), headquartered in Berkeley, CA. We went over topics in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and ML Safety, including trojans, robustness and interpretability, all while implementing what we learned in Python using standard ML libraries. There were numerous guest speakers and discussion opportunities, as well as the analysis of many relevant papers in the field.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning is a rapdily growing field, both in industry and at academic institutions. Earlier this year, some formal results on the accuracy (or lack thereof) of neural networks were published, initiating a classification theory on the limitations of deep learning, reminiscent of similar work by Godel and Turing in the fields of logic and computer science, respectively.
After coming across this paper by Colbrook, Antun and Hansen, I decided to give a proof of Theorem 2.</description>
