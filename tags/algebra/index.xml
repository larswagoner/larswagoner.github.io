      <description>In this project for the &amp;ldquo;Honours Programme&amp;rdquo; I studied and presented The Fundamental Theorem for Finitely Generated Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain, along with the relevant lemmas, corollaries and algorithms. In particular, I deduced and presented an algorithm to determine the structure of a module M in terms of the direct sums of quotient modules of a Euclidean Domain, R.

      <description>In late 2021, I had the absolute pleasure to do an independent study as a part of the &amp;ldquo;Honours Programme&amp;rdquo; at my university. My topic of choice was Combinatorial Group Theory which, roughly speaking, studies groups from their presentations. In the paper, I formally define what a group presentation is (based off of the Free Group on a set) and give several other important definitions. I gave particular emphasis to a nice set of tools called Tietze Transformations, which I used later in the paper.</description>
